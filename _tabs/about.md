Hello, and welcome to my blog.

I'm Theldus, just a random guy doing random things.

My interests revolve around IT, predominantly into low-level programming,
libraries, operating systems, performance analysis, C programming, and more.
I'm a full-time Linux user, with Slackware serving as my main distro.
Beyond IT, I also have a passion for photography (including astrofotography)
and anime.

Additionally, I maintain a [small YouTube channel] where I sporadically upload
videos showcasing topics I believe are better demonstrated visually than in
text, such as [my playlist on BIOS reverse engineering].

I'm a cat person and proud owner of three =).
